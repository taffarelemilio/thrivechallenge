Practical Exercise – Dashboard Tabs with React Query

🧩 Goal

Build a small Next.js page that contains:
- 2 tabs
  - Characters
  - Locations
- Each tab fetches data from the Rick & Morty API  
  https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation
- Display a simple styled card per item (no pagination required)
- Avoid unnecessary refetching when switching tabs

This exercise is meant to simulate a small feature inside a dashboard-style application.

🤖 AI Usage Disclosure

You are allowed to use AI tools.

If you used any AI tool during development, please specify in this README:
- Which tool you used (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.)
- For what purpose (e.g., scaffolding, debugging, typing interfaces, etc.)

We are not judging AI usage negatively.
We want transparency and to understand how you integrate tools into your workflow.
